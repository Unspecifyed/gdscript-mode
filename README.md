This is a major mode for GDScript. It's incomplete but I need this so it'll be complete soon. 

This was all a lie. :( 

~~I'd like to actually make a mode but I've never done it before. You can pretty much ignore everything except
```lisp
(define-derived-mode gdscript-mode python-mode "GDScript")
```
since GDScript is so much like Python this actually works pretty well. Hopefully someday I'll figure out how to 
make this mode a little better.

Just add ```(require 'gdscript)``` in your init file and you should be good to go.~~
