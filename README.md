This is a repackaged version of gdscript-mode for spacemacs.  All credit to the major mode belongs to "akoaysigod".

## Installation
- Clone this repo into your `.emacs.d/private` directory as "godot":  `clone https://github.com/brenttaylor/gdscript-mode.git godot`
- Add `godot` to your `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` list in your `.spacemacs` file.

## Help
Much like the original creator of gdscript-mode, I've never written a layer or major mode for emacs before.  Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated.
