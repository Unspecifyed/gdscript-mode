This is a repackaged version of gdscript-mode for spacemacs.  All credit to the major mode belongs to "akoaysigod".

## Installation
Clone this repo into your `.emacs.d/private` directory and add `godot` to your `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers` list.

## Help
Much like the original creator of gdscript-mode, I've never written a layer or major mode for emacs before.  Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated.
